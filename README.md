### BitClock

BitClock is a clock in & out system designed specifically for Noorderpoort. It is built using the Laravel framework for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend.

# Project Overview

BitClock was created for Noorderpoort with the following purposes and features in mind:

-   **Clock In & Out**: BitClock allows students to easily clock in and out of their activities, making it a convenient tool for tracking their time spent on various tasks or classes.

-   **Overview for Teachers**: For teachers and educators, BitClock provides a comprehensive overview of student activities. This can help educators monitor attendance and student engagement.

-   **Laravel + Vue.js**: The project is built using the Laravel PHP framework for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend. This technology stack allows for robust functionality and a responsive user interface.

-   **Read-Only Project**: BitClock is designed as a read-only project, meaning it is primarily intended for demonstration purposes. It showcases the potential functionality of a clock in & out system but may require additional development to be used in a production environment.

-   **Unfinished**: It's important to note that BitClock is an unfinished project. This means that there may be missing features or bugs that need to be addressed for it to be fully functional.
